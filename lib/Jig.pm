=head1 NAME

Jig - Tools for Crafting Code in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I've been slinging code for a very long time.  In that time, I've reinvented
hundreds of wheels, mostly because while all wheels are round, they don't
always have the right number of bolts, or the right tread, or they can't
withstand the forces to be placed upon them.

Anyhow, I've started keeping all of my own code, for no reason other than
the fact that I grow weary of (a) reinventing wheels and (b) chasing other
people's idea of what wheels really are / should be this year / month / day.
